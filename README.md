# Tontine
A repository for any code I write for analyzing, tracking, or winning Tontine.

Tontine ( https://tontine.cash/ ) is a MSCHF game. On 2021-12-27, 7141 players each paid $10 into a central pot and have been required to check in at least once a day by midnight EST/EDT or else be eliminated. The last remaining player will win the pot. As of 2023-12-31, 312 players remain.

Analysis Google sheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scomCAeojAeMXYI4x7dtftkxXGdvG7g8Kj7MWulscU8/edit?usp=sharing
(If you are perusing my Github and want to know whether I can do data analysis at all, have a look please!)
- Additionally, tontine-data-science.py is a better version of the best parts of the linked sheet; if you want to use it, make sure to also download tontinepop.txt (or compile the living player counts some other way).
